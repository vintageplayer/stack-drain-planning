# Task Index

Use this file as the quick status dashboard for all tasks.

| Task ID | Title | Status | Owner | Last Updated | Task File | PRs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| T-0001 | Define MVP scope and architecture baseline | Planned | Aditya | 2026-02-05 | `docs/tasks/T-0001-mvp-scope-and-architecture-baseline.md` | pending |
| T-xxxx | <title> | Planned | <owner> | YYYY-MM-DD | `docs/tasks/T-xxxx-<slug>.md` | <links or pending> |

## Update Rule

When any task status changes, update this row in the same change as the task file update.
