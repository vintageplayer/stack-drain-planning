## Metadata

- Task ID: `T-0001`
- Status: `Planned`
- Owner: `Aditya`
- Created: `2026-02-05`
- Last Updated: `2026-02-05`

## Why

Establish a shared, decision-ready baseline for product scope and architecture before implementation begins across multiple component repositories.

## Scope

In scope:

- Define MVP capabilities and non-goals
- Identify initial components/repositories required
- Define integration boundaries between components
- Capture key open questions and decision points

Out of scope:

- Implementation code changes in component repositories
- Detailed sprint-level execution planning

## Components Impacted

- [x] `stack-drain-planning`
- [ ] `web-app` (future repo)
- [ ] `automations` (future repo)

## Acceptance Criteria

1. MVP scope is documented with explicit in-scope and out-of-scope items.
2. Initial multi-repo component map is documented.
3. Unknowns and decisions are listed and prioritized.
4. Follow-up tasks for component setup are identified.

## Execution Streams

- [x] `planning stream`
- [ ] `web stream` (future)
- [ ] `automation stream` (future)

## PR Links

- `stack-drain-planning`: pending

## Notes

First foundational planning task. Use this task to drive creation of follow-up tasks for repository setup and first implementation milestones.
