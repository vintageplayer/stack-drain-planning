# Stack Drain Planning

This repository is the planning source of truth for the Stack Drain initiative.

## Scope

- Capture task intent (`why`, `what`, expected outcomes)
- Track cross-component execution state
- Preserve key decisions that guide implementation

## Working Model

- Planning artifacts live in this repo
- Implementation happens in component repos
- Tasks are linked across threads, branches, and PRs using a shared task ID
